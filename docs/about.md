I am Kaouther Abrougui, a passionate, motivated, ambitious person. I believe that everything is possible when enough dedication and discipline are put into a potential goal. I love to play that role of enabler and stimulator to my surroundings, whether it be by enabling my kids to be strong, strive and dream about their future; or stimulating my colleagues to get things done in face of challenges while staying motivated and enthusiasts; or encouraging a friend to keep pushing on that last mile during a hard hike, and earn that satisfactory accomplishment feeling at the end. 
I earned my PhD degree in 2011 in Computer Science and started my journey in research and development. There are 2 life lessons that I learned through my PhD journey, that I keep applying every day in my life and use to empower everyone around me: "Keep moving forward with eyes on your goal", "The greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall".

I am passionate about learning, growing, and innovating. I believe in the power of persistence and perseverance.

Motto: "Small daily improvements when done consistently over time lead to stunning results!"
